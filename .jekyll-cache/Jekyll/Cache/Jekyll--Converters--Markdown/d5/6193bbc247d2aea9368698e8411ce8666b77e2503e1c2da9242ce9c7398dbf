I"þ<p>Due to the ever-increasing scope of small satellite missions, there is now significant demand for precise attitude determination and control capabilities onboard CubeSats. Interactions between magnetic torque coils and the Earthâ€™s magnetic field have been used for decades onboard satellites to offload momentum from reaction wheels and control-moment gyroscopes. However, magnetorquers are inherently underactuated, and mechanical actuators like reaction wheels are often prohibitively expensive in terms of mass, volume, power, and cost for CubeSat missions.</p>

<p>This research investigates magnetorquer-only attitude control technique that utilizes trajectory optimization to circumvent the under-actuated nature of satellite magnetic field interactions. Given a known orbit and desired attitude state, current methods utilize a simplified dynamics model and a fast constrained trajectory optimization solver based on differential dynamic programming to arrive at a nominal torque profile that respects the spacecraftâ€™s actuator limitations and desired actuation efficiency. Nominal maneuvers are then tracked online using a time-varying linear-quadratic regulator (LQR).</p>

<p>Future work includes implementation of the algorithm to embedded hardware through a flat-sat prototype. This will involve base-level programing and component selection. Once the system has been validated, the attitude dynamcis will be fed into the hardware and the systemâ€™s resulting control inputs can then be compared to simulation.</p>
