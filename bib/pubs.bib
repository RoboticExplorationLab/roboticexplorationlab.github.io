  abstract = {Planning locomotion trajectories for legged microrobots is challenging because of their complex morphology, high frequency passive dynamics, and discontinuous contact interactions with their environment. Consequently, such research is often driven by time-consuming experimental methods. As an alternative, we present a framework for systematically modeling, planning, and controlling legged microrobots. We develop a threedimensional dynamic model of a 1.5 g quadrupedal microrobot with complexity (e.g., number of degrees of freedom) similar to larger-scale legged robots. We then adapt a recently developed variational contact-implicit trajectory optimization method to generate feasible whole-body locomotion plans for this microrobot, and we demonstrate that these plans can be tracked with simple joint-space controllers. We plan and execute periodic gaits at multiple stride frequencies and on various surfaces. These gaits achieve high per-cycle velocities, including a maximum of 10.87 mm/cycle, which is 15\% faster than previously measured velocities for this microrobot. Furthermore, we plan and execute a vertical jump of 9.96 mm, which is 78\% of the microrobot's center-of-mass height. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first end-to-end demonstration of planning and tracking whole-body dynamic locomotion on a millimeter-scale legged microrobot.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a magnetorquer-only attitude control technique that utilizes
trajectory optimization methods to circumvent the underactuated nature of satellite magnetic field interactions. Given a known orbit and desired attitude state,
the method utilizes a nonlinear dynamics model and a fast constrained trajectory optimization solver based on differential dynamic programming to arrive at
a nominal torque profile that respects the spacecraft's actuator limitations. This
nominal maneuver is then tracked using a time-varying linear-quadratic regulator
(LQR). To demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed control
technique, closed-loop Monte-Carlo simulations are performed from a variety of orbits and initial conditions. Our method is shown to significantly outperform
previous magnetorquer-only control schemes by offering convergence from large initial errors and fast slew rates that exploit the full performance capabilities of the actuators. Computational complexity of the method and future implementation in flight software onboard a CubeSat are also discussed.},

  abstract = {Learning accurate dynamics models is necessary for optimal, compliant control of robotic systems. Current approaches to white-box modeling using analytic parameterizations, or black-box modeling using neural networks, can suffer from high bias or high variance. We address the need for a flexible, gray-box model of mechanical systems that can seamlessly incorporate prior knowledge where it is available, and train expressive function approximators where it is not. We propose to parameterize a mechanical system using neural networks to model its Lagrangian and the generalized forces that act on it. We test our method on a simulated, actuated double pendulum. We show that our method outperforms a naive, black-box model in terms of data-efficiency, as well as performance in model-based reinforcement learning. We also conduct a systematic study of our method's ability to incorporate available prior knowledge about the system to improve data efficiency.},

Python enables dramatically simplified CubeSat software development, allowing students and researchers to quickly and reliably integrate new sensors, control algorithms, and payload hardware into their missions.

  abstract = {Trajectory optimization is a widely used tool with many important applications in robotic motion planning and control. However, most existing algorithm implementations fall into one of two categories: either they rely on general-purpose off-the-shelf nonlinear programming solvers that are numerically robust and capable of handling arbitrary constraints but tend to be slow, or they use custom numerical methods that are fast but lack robustness and have limited or no ability to deal with constraints. This paper presents ALTRO (Augmented Lagrangian TRajectory Optimizer), a novel algorithm for solving constrained trajectory optimization problems that bridges this gap by offering fast convergence, numerical robustness, and the ability to handle general nonlinear state and input constraints. We demonstrate ALTRO's capabilities on a set of benchmark motion-planning problems and offer comparisons to the standard direct collocation (DIRCOL) method.},

However, maximal-coordinate approaches have several advantages over minimal-coordinate parameterizations, including native handling of closed kinematic loops and nonholonomic constraints. This paper describes a linear-time variational integrator that is formulated in maximal coordinates. Due to its variational formulation, the algorithm does not suffer from constraint drift and has favorable energy and momentum conservation properties. A sparse matrix factorization technique allows the dynamics of a loop-free articulated mechanism with n links to be computed in O(n) (linear) time. Additional constraints that introduce loops can also be handled by the algorithm without incurring much computational overhead. Experimental results show that our approach offers speed competitive with existing minimalcoordinate algorithms while outperforming them in several scenarios, especially when dealing with closed loops and configuration singularities.},
