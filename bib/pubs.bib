However, maximal-coordinate approaches have several advantages over minimal-coordinate parameterizations, including native handling of closed kinematic loops and nonholonomic constraints. This paper describes a linear-time variational integrator that is formulated in maximal coordinates. Due to its variational formulation, the algorithm does not suffer from constraint drift and has favorable energy and momentum conservation properties. A sparse matrix factorization technique allows the dynamics of a loop-free articulated mechanism with n links to be computed in O(n) (linear) time. Additional constraints that introduce loops can also be handled by the algorithm without incurring much computational overhead. Experimental results show that our approach offers speed competitive with existing minimalcoordinate algorithms while outperforming them in several scenarios, especially when dealing with closed loops and configuration singularities.},

This paper presents a novel approach for uncertainty propagation during entry, descent and landing that relies on a new sum-of-squares robust verification technique. Unlike risk-based and probabilistic approaches, our technique does not rely on any probabilistic assumptions. It uses a set-based description to bound uncertainties and disturbances like vehicle and atmospheric parameters and winds. The approach leverages a recently developed sampling-based version of sum-of-squares programming to compute regions of finite time invariance, commonly refered to as ``invariant funnels''. We apply this approach to a three-degree-of-freedom entry vehicle model and test it using a Mars Science Laboratory reference trajectory. We compute tight approximations of robust invariant funnels that are guaranteed to reach a goal region with increased landing accuracy while respecting realistic thermal constraints.},

Consequently, such research is often driven by time-consuming experimental methods. As an alternative, we present a framework for systematically modeling, planning, and controlling legged microrobots. We develop a threedimensional dynamic model of a 1.5 g quadrupedal microrobot with complexity (e.g., number of degrees of freedom) similar to larger-scale legged robots. We then adapt a recently developed variational contact-implicit trajectory optimization method to generate feasible whole-body locomotion plans for this microrobot, and we demonstrate that these plans can be tracked with simple joint-space controllers. We plan and execute periodic gaits at multiple stride frequencies and on various surfaces. These gaits achieve high per-cycle velocities, including a maximum of 10.87 mm/cycle, which is 15\% faster than previously measured velocities for this microrobot. Furthermore, we plan and execute a vertical jump of 9.96 mm, which is 78\% of the microrobot's center-of-mass height. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first end-to-end demonstration of planning and tracking whole-body dynamic locomotion on a millimeter-scale legged microrobot.},

Given a known orbit and desired attitude state, the method utilizes a nonlinear dynamics model and a fast constrained trajectory optimization solver based on differential dynamic programming to arrive at a nominal torque profile that respects the spacecraft's actuator limitations. This nominal maneuver is then tracked using a time-varying linear-quadratic regulator (LQR). To demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed control technique, closed-loop Monte-Carlo simulations are performed from a variety of orbits and initial conditions. Our method is shown to significantly outperform previous magnetorquer-only control schemes by offering convergence from large initial errors and fast slew rates that exploit the full performance capabilities of the actuators. Computational complexity of the method and future implementation in flight software onboard a CubeSat are also discussed.},

PyCubed addresses many hardwarerelated failure modes through component and system-level radiation testing, in-depth design and qualification documentation, and flight heritage on a successful LEO mission. The challenge of flight software development is also mitigated through the use of the Python programming language via CircuitPython. Python enables dramatically simplified CubeSat software development, allowing students and researchers to quickly and reliably integrate new sensors, control algorithms, and payload hardware into their missions.

However, most existing algorithm implementations fall into one of two categories: either they rely on general-purpose off-the-shelf nonlinear programming solvers that are numerically robust and capable of handling arbitrary constraints but tend to be slow, or they use custom numerical methods that are fast but lack robustness and have limited or no ability to deal with constraints. This paper presents ALTRO (Augmented Lagrangian TRajectory Optimizer), a novel algorithm for solving constrained trajectory optimization problems that bridges this gap by offering fast convergence, numerical robustness, and the ability to handle general nonlinear state and input constraints. We demonstrate ALTRO's capabilities on a set of benchmark motion-planning problems and offer comparisons to the standard direct collocation (DIRCOL) method.},

We evaluate our solver in the context of autonomous driving on scenarios with a strong level of interactions between the vehicles. We assess the robustness of the solver using Monte Carlo simulations. It is able to reliably solve complex problems like ramp merging with three vehicles three times faster than a state-of-the-art DDP-based approach.

  abstract   = {Contact constraints arise naturally in many robot planning problems. In recent years, a variety of contact-implicit trajectory optimization algorithms have been developed that avoid the pitfalls of mode pre-specification by simultaneously optimizing state, input, and contact force trajectories. However, their reliance on first-order integrators leads to a linear tradeoff between optimization problem size and plan accuracy. To address this limitation, we propose a new family of trajectory optimization algorithms that leverage ideas from discrete variational mechanics to derive higher-order generalizations of the classic time-stepping method of Stewart and Trinkle. By using this dynamics formulation as constraints in a direct trajectory optimization scheme, it is possible to perform contact-implicit trajectory optimization with significantly improved accuracy compared to existing methods. For concreteness, we derive a second-order method and evaluate it using several simulated rigid body systems.},

In addition, we use this second-order method to plan locomotion trajectories for a complex quadrupedal microrobot. The planned trajectories are evaluated on the physical platform and result in a number of performance improvements.},
