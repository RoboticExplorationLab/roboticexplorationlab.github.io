We've teamed up with talented students from the Stanford Robotics Club to dedevelop control algorithms for new quadrupeds entirely designed by students of the Club. This project focuses on implementing state-of-the-art control strategies and getting them to run reliably on custom hardware. This project is look for talented and motivated students to contribute, especially undergraduate students.
