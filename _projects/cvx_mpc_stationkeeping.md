We present a series of works using convex model predictive control for stationkeeping maneuver design of unstable halo orbits. One work proives fuel-optimal impulsive stationkeeping maneuvers as well as a safety plan thorughout the entire mission. The other work uses a solar sail propulsion model to generate the maneuvers. We validate our algorithms in simulations of the three-body Earth-Moon and Saturn-Enceladus systems demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.
